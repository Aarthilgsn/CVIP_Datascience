# Breast Cancer Classification Model
This project is focused on developing a predictive model for classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. 
Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data, we aim to provide a reliable tool to assist medical 
professionals in diagnosing breast cancer

# Description
Breast cancer is a critical healthcare concern. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment. 
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist medical professionals in the diagnosis of 
breast cancer based on relevant features extracted from patient data and mammogram images.

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# usage
In jupyter notebook users can run your breast cancer prediction code. Include any necessary command-line arguments, 
configuration settings, or steps, also they can use different model selection  and adjusting the hyperparameter 
according to their convience.

# Acknowledgement
We would like to thank the University of Wisconsin Hospitals for providing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, 
which has been instrumental in this research and Kaggle.
